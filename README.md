## JavaScript

JavaScript is the most popular Programming language in the world. Over [97%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-deployedstats-12) of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

## Why JavaScript?

Why not? All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. It can be used in Front-end, Back-end, Android, IOS, Desktop & AI also.

## JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures

It's not enough to know how to write a simple program to do something. You need to know how to write a program that can solve a problem with the most efficient way. That's why we need to know Algorithms & Data Structures. This repository contains a collection of JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Code.

## Motive

It will be helpful for any future Programmer, who want to learn JavaScript from `Basic` to `Advance` by practice & solving problem. It will be a good experience to for Programmers because of the following reasons:

- Codes are written from scratch to advance.
- These are the code of [freeCodeCamp](#free-code-camp) course.
- All codes are written in JavaScript.
- Easy to understand.
